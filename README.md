# Twituino Sample 1
## Turn on an LED with Twitter

Twituino can be found at [davidlong03/twituino](http://github.com/davidlong03/twituino).

To setup your board for this sample place an LED light at pin 13 on your board.  Then start up the Arduino code on your board.  After the board is running start Twituino with the correct serial port settings and send your tweet.  When a tweet comes in the LED light will light up for 15 seconds.

*Code tested on Arduino UNO board.  Please fork this repo if you test this code on a different board and it works*
